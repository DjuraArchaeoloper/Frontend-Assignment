# Frontend Assignment

The project was created using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.7.
Download the project and install `Angular` and `NodeJS`.
Afterwards run `npm install`, in the command prompt and root folder.

When the `node-modules` have finished installing, run `ng serve` in the terminal or node command prompt in order to start the project.

Open in your browser using `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically refresh if you change something in the code.

I completed the project using NodeJS, Angular and Bootstrap in Visual Studio code.

The goal was to present data from a JSON API in a table, with the possibility of filtering, sorting and pagination.

The filtering, i.e. search form was created so that everything can be searched through, and multiple data can be combined if necessary.

The sorting is placed in the table headers, working on smallest to largest and vice versa principle.

The application itself was created in Angular, using ng-pipes for certain tasks (pagination, sorting, filtering), while the visual representation was executed using Bootstrap and CSS stylesheet.
